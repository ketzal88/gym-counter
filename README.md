1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Replace `TU_API_KEY_AQU√ç` with your Google API Key (see "Google Sheets Integration" section)

### Deploying to Vercel

To deploy this application to Vercel, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and sign up/login
3. Click on "New Project"
4. Import your GitHub repository
5. Under "Environment Variables", add `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY` with your Google API Key
6. Vercel will detect it's a Next.js project and configure the build settings automatically
7. Click "Deploy"

Once deployed, you'll get a URL where your app is accessible to everyone.

## Google Sheets Integration (Optional)

By default, GymCounter stores data in your browser's localStorage. To enable syncing between devices, follow these steps to integrate with Google Sheets:

1. Use this Google Sheet as your data source: [GymCounter Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sJmsAry32FM0A1jlyM1bWI9VyyBHedX65PyLUNVahXI/edit)
2. Create a project in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
3. Enable the Google Sheets API in your project
4. Create API credentials (API Key)
5. Configure this API Key as an environment variable:
   - Locally: in your `.env.local` file
   - Vercel: in project settings under "Environment Variables"

For security reasons, it's recommended to restrict your API key to only work with the Google Sheets API and from specific domains (your Vercel domain and localhost for development).

For detailed steps, see the [Google Spreadsheet documentation](https://theoephraim.github.io/node-google-spreadsheet/#/getting-started/authentication).

## How It Works

- The app uses your browser's localStorage to keep track of gym visits
- Each person gets a counter with a "+1" button to record gym visits
- The history section shows when each person went to the gym
- The app tracks consecutive days to help maintain your gym streak
- Random motivational quotes appear to keep you inspired
