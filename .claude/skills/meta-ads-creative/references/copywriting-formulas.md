# Copywriting Formulas for Meta Ads

**Purpose:** Battle-tested copy structures for writing Meta ad primary text, headlines, and descriptions.

---

## The Meta Ads Value Formula

Before any copywriting, remember:

**Value = Dream Outcome x Perceived Likelihood / Time Delay x Effort**

Your copy must communicate:
- **Dream Outcome:** What transformation do they want?
- **Perceived Likelihood:** Will this work for THEM?
- **Time Delay:** How long until results?
- **Effort Required:** How hard is this?

**Maximize the top (outcome x likelihood), minimize the bottom (time x effort).**

## PRIMARY TEXT FORMULAS

### PAS (Problem - Agitate - Solution)

**Structure:**
```
[PROBLEM - State the pain point clearly]

[AGITATE - Make the problem feel more urgent/painful]

[SOLUTION - Introduce your solution as the answer]

[CTA - What to do next]
```

**Example:**
```
Homeschooling sounds great until you see the price tag.

Curriculum: $500-2,000. Classes: $100-300/month. Co-ops, field trips, supplies...
it adds up fast. And suddenly the "freedom" feels like financial stress.

What if you could access all of that - curriculum, classes, resources, support -
without the cost?

OpenEd is a tuition-free program that gives families everything they need.
Apply in 5 minutes.
```

**Best For:**

My son went from C student to 4.0 in one year.

Same kid. Same intelligence. Different environment.

Teachers said she needed to "keep up" with everyone else.

But she wasn't keeping up. She was falling further behind.

Then we joined OpenEd. She could finally take the time
to master concepts before moving on.

Within a year, she caught up. Now she's ahead.

The problem was never her intelligence.
It was an environment that didn't fit.
