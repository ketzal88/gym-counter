# Creative Research Methods: Finding Trending Ad Formats

**Purpose:** Discover trending ad formats, creative concepts, and content styles that are working RIGHT NOW - then adapt them for OpenEd campaigns.

---

## Philosophy

The best Meta ads often borrow formats from organic content that's already working. Instead of inventing new formats, we find what's resonating and adapt it.

**Key Principle:** Look for FORMATS, not just messaging. The delivery mechanism matters as much as the message.
