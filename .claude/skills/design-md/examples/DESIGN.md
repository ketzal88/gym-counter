# Design System: AI Worker Generator / AI Analyzer
**Project ID:** 5165520689568295033

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere
The design system for this project is anchored in a **Sleek, Professional Dark Mode** aesthetic. It prioritizes clarity, technical precision, and a high-performance "command center" feel. The atmosphere is dense but organized, utilizing subtle elevation and high-contrast primary accents to guide the user's attention through complex data-heavy interfaces.

## 2. Color Palette & Roles
*   **Vibrant Electric Blue (#135BEC):** The primary brand color. Used for main action buttons (CTA), active state borders, and critical UI highlights. It provides a focal point against the dark background.
*   **Deep Space Background (#030712):** The base background color for all screens. Provides maximum contrast for text and vibrant accents.
*   **Surface Graphite (#111827):** Used for card backgrounds, navigation sidewalls, and header areas. This creates a clear hierarchy and visual layering.
*   **Subtle Slate Border (#1F2937):** Used for component outlines and table separators to maintain structure without adding visual noise.
*   **Success Emerald (#10B981):** Used for positive status indicators and completion markers.
*   **Warning Amber (#F59E0B):** Used for cautionary notices or pending actions.

## 3. Typography Rules
*   **Font Family:** Inter (primary sans-serif font).
*   **Headings:** Bold weights (700) with slight letter-spacing reduction for a compact, authoritative feel.
*   **Body Text:** Regular weight (400) for high readability. Secondary info uses Slate text colors to reduce visual weight.
*   **Monospace:** Used for Project IDs, Hex codes, and technical logs.

## 4. Component Stylings
*   Button Shape:** Subtly rounded (8px / `rounded-lg`).
*   **Primary Buttons:** Solid Electric Blue background with white text. Hover state increases brightness slightly.
*   **Secondary Buttons:** Ghost style (transparent background) with Electric Blue borders and text.
*   **Cards/Containers:** Surface Graphite background with 8px rounding and a very subtle Slate border. No heavy shadows; depth is communicated through background color shifts.
*   **Inputs/Forms:** 1px Slate border on Surface Graphite background. Focus state switches border to Electric Blue with a thin outer glow.

## 5. Layout Principles
*   **Density:** Medium-high. Components are tightly packed but grouped logically with consistent 16px or 24px padding.
*   **Alignment:** Grid-based, predominantly left-aligned text with centered layout for landing/login components.
*   **Whitespace:** Used strategically to separate distinct functional areas (e.g., Sidebar vs. Main Feed).
